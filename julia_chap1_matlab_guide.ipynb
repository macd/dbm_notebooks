It is also useful to read about [noteworthy differences](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/noteworthy-differences/#noteworthy-differences-from-matlab) between Matlab, R, and Python as compared to Julia.  The original paper describing the Julia language can be found [here.](http://www-math.mit.edu/~edelman/homepage/papers/juliafast.pdf)  [IPython](http://ipython.org/) , from which the IJulia project evolved, is discussed in reference [2] and is currently evolving again to [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)\n",

    "One way to install Julia and supporting software is to first install [anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) which installs a Python environment which contains the plotting package **matplotlib** and the very useful **IPython shell** and **IPython/IJulia Notebook** (which is what you are reading now). Then install Julia from [here](http://julialang.org/downloads/).  Finally, in the Julia shell type in **Pkg.add(\"PyPlot\")** for plotting and **Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")** for the IPython Notebook with a Julia backend, after the **julia>** prompt.  One of the examples uses the ordinary differential equation solver package \"ODE\", and that can be installed by **Pkg.add(\"ODE\")**.  Once you have finished, you can start the IJulia notebook with the command **ipython notebook --profile=julia**\n",

    "# Chapter 1 A Brief Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn Julia is by trying it yourself, and hence we begin with a whirlwind tour. Working through the examples below will give you a feel for the way that Julia operates and an appreciation of its power and ﬂexibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is entirely independent of the rest of the book—all the Julia features introduced are discussed in greater detail in the subsequent chapters. Indeed, in order to keep this chapter brief, we have not explained all the functions used here. You can use the index in [1] to ﬁnd out more about particular topics that interest you. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Julia interactive shell as well as the IJulia notebook (which is what you are reading now) throughout this tutorial.  You can install these by following the directions at [IPython install](http://ipython.org/install.html) (or see the instructions above). This tutorial contains commands for you to type at the Julia command line. Alternatively, if you are viewing this notebook in a \"live\" mode served from a local IJulia notebook server running with --profile=julia, you can directly modify any of the cells and rerun the cell.  Just be aware that in some cases you may need to choose the \"Run All\" option from the cell drop down menu to satisfy intercell dependences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last part of this brief tutorial we give examples of script files and functions. These ﬁles are short, so you can type them in quickly or cut and paste them into an Julia shell, or you can just modify values in place in the IJulia notebook and re-evaluate the cell. You should experiment as you proceed, keeping the following points in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Upper and lower case characters are not equivalent (Julia is case sensitive). \n",
    "* Typing the name of a variable will cause Julia to display its current value. \n",
    "* Julia uses parentheses, ( ), square brackets, [ ], and curly braces, { }, and these are not interchangeable. \n",
    "* In the Julia shell, the up arrow and down arrow keys can be used to scroll through your previous commands. Also, an old command can be recalled by typing the first few characters followed by up arrow. You can also use **ctrl-p** (type p while holding the control key down) to scroll back through the command history stack.  To move to the end of the line, type **ctrl-e**, to the beginning of the line **ctrl-a**.\n",
    "* You can type ?(topic) to access online help on the command, function, or object topic. Note that hyperlinks, indicated by underlines, are provided that will take you to related help items and the Help browser. \n",
    "* If you press the tab key after partially typing a function or variable name, Julia will attempt to complete it, offering you a selection of choices if there is more than one possible completion. \n",
    "* You can quit Julia by typing exit() or quit() or ctrl-d.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having entered the Julia command, you should work through this tutorial by typing in the text that appears after the prompt, **In [n]:** where n is a number which indicates the command's location in the command stack, in the command window. After showing you what to type, we display the output that is produced. We begin with arrays.  In native Julia arrays are lists denoted with the square bracket syntax."

It has been conjectured that this iteration will always lead to a value of 1 (and hence thereafter cycle between 4, 2, and 1) whatever starting value $x_{1}$ is chosen. There is ample computational evidence to support this conjecture, which is variously known as the Collatz problem, the $3x + 1$ problem, the Syracuse problem, Kakutani’s problem, Hasse’s algorithm, and Ulam’s problem. However, a rigorous proof has so far eluded mathematicians. For further details, see [63] listed in [1] or type “Collatz problem” into your favorite Web search engine. You can investigate the conjecture by creating the Julia script ﬁle collatz.jl shown below. In this file a while loop and an if statement are used to implement the iteration. You can run this in the notebook simply by changing the value of n and hitting the play button.  Or, you can save this to a file named collatz.jl (remembering to uncommment out the line '\\#print... and commenting out the line \"n = 27\". Then, from the **julia>** repl prompt, type \"run collatz\". The input command prompts you for a starting value. The appropriate response is to type an integer and then hit return."

    "The Well-known and much studied Mandelbrot set can be approximated graphically in just a few lines of Julia. It is deﬁned as the set of points c in the complex plane for which the sequence generated by the map $z \\mapsto z^{2} + c$, starting with $z = c$, remains bounded [91, Chap. 14] listed in [1]. The script mandel in the next listing produces the plot of the Mandelbrot set shown in Figure 1.7. The script contains calls to linspace of the form linspace (a, b ,n), which generate an equally spaced vector of n values between a and b. The repmat function repeats(z, m, n) repeats a matrix z m-times in the first dimension and n-times in the second dimension. The **complex** function is used to construct a matrix C that represents the rectangular region of interest in the complex plane. Using **complex** is generally faster than using a + 1im\\*b.  The plot itself is produced by **contourf**, which plots a ﬁlled contour. The expression $abs(Z)<Z\\_max$ in the call to contourf detects points that have not exceeded the threshold Z_max and that are therefore assumed to lie in the Mandelbrot set. You can experiment with mandel by changing the region that is plotted, via the **linspace** calls, the number of iterations **it_max**, the threshold **Z_max**, as well as the density of the grid **mc**."

Given a triangle with vertices $P_{a}$, $P_{b}$, and $P_{c}$, We remove the triangle with vertices at the midpoints of the edges, $(P_{a} + P_{b})/2$, $(P_{b} + P_{c}) / 2$, and $(P_{c} + P_{a}) / 2$. This removes the “middle quarter” of the triangle, as illustrated in Figure 1.9. (The code in the function 'gasket' will be explained below)"

    "Effectively, we have replaced the original triangle with three “subtriangles”. We can now apply the middle quarter removal process to each of these subtriangles to generate nine subsubtriangles, and so on. The Sierpinski gasket is the set of all points that are never removed by repeated application of this process. The function gasket in the listing above implements the removal process. The input arguments $P\\_{a}$, $P\\_{b}$, and $P\\_{c}$ deﬁne the vertices of the triangle and level speciﬁes how many times the process is to be applied. If level is nonzero then gasket calls itself three times with level reduced by 1, once for each of the three subtriangles. When level ﬁnally reaches zero, the recursion 'bottoms-out' and the appropriate triangle is drawn. The following code generates Figure 1.10."

Then we take the midpoint of the line joining this point and a randomly chosen vertex as the next point, which is plotted, and the process continues.

To understand how it works you will need to be familiar with Chapter 5 and 21.4 of reference [1].
